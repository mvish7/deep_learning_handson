# Deep Learning Hands_on

This repository contains the deep learning components implemented from scratch and with pytorch. 
For in detailed theory of deep learning, mathemetics behind it's operations I referred the [Dive into Deep Learning book](https://d2l.ai/). The code part in this book is based on [mxnet](https://gluon.mxnet.io/). For the sake of practice I tried to implemnted  all the components into pytorch / numpy or useing basic python functionalities.

The [d2l book](https://d2l.ai/) is already porte into Pytorch based codes and can be found [here](https://github.com/dsgiitr/d2l-pytorch). My implementation of all the functions that form components of a deep neural network can be found in dl_functions.py script.
